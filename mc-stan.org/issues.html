    <p>Stan uses an issue tracker for reporting and monitoring progress
    on bug fixes and feature requests.  Bugs include bugs in Stan, its
    interfaces, installation, sample models, or documentation typos or
    brainos.</p>

    <p>Users can report bugs or request features by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>mailing the appropriate <a class="internal"
      href="groups.html">user's group</a>, or </li>

      <li> opening an issue on the appropriate issue tracker.  </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The issue trackers for Stan and its interfaces are linked below.</p>



    <h2>How to Report Bugs</h2>

    <p>The rest of this page explains how to report bugs or request
    features to make it easy for the development team to respond.  We
    try to be responsive and track issues, but sometimes get behind or
    forget;  if you have reported a bug and it doesn't get resolved,
    please remind us on the issue tracker, through the user's mailing
    list, or in a direct email.</p>

    <p>The key to a successful bug report is to provide as much context as
    possible.  Ideally, this will be in the form of a small example that
    allows the developers to easily reproduce the bug.</p>

    <p>Installation issues should be discussed on the user's group; some
    of these may be promoted to bugs or feature requests depending on
    their root cause.</p>

    <p>Documentation typos, brainos, or requests for more information
    may reported either on the user's list or issue tracker.  Reports
    should include the name of the document or web site and version as
    well as page numbers or a link.</p>

    <p>Modeling issues that have not been isolated in small reproducible
    examples should first be discussed on the user's group.</p>

    <p>Bugs that have been isolated to reproducible examples may be
    reported on the user's list or issue tracker.  Bug reports should
    include information about</p>
    <ul>
      <li> interface (RStan, PyStan, CmdStan) with version,</li>
      <li> underlying language version (R, Python, Shell)</li>
      <li> language byte size (32 or 64 bit),</li>
      <li> operating system (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) with version,</li>
      <li> memory available, and</li>
      <li> compiler (clang++, g++) with version.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most importantly, it is almost impossible to diagnose a bug
    without the</p>
    <ul>
      <li>full model file and data that produces the bug.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Request Features</h2>

    <p>The Stan developers are happy to field feature requests from
    users.  Feature requests can be for new functions to support, new
    samplers, support for platforms, etc.  Please provide as much
    information as possible, including links to papers or formulas.</p>

    <p>Feature requests should be made either on the user's group or
    using the issue tracker.</p>

    <h2>Issue Trackers</h2> 

    <p>For issues with Stan models, including requests for model
    features or problems fitting models, use:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a class="external"
      href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues">Stan Issue Tracker</a><img
      class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external pdf
      marker"/>
      <span class="note">(on Stan's GitHub)</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For issues that are limited to RStan, PyStan, or CmdStan, use one
    of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a class="external"
      href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/issues">RStan Issue Tracker</a><img
      class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external pdf
      marker"/>
      <span class="note">(on RStan's GitHub)</span>
      </li>

      <li><a class="external"
      href="https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan/issues">PyStan Issue Tracker</a><img
      class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external pdf
      marker"/>
      <span class="note">(on PyStan's GitHub)</span>
      </li>

      <li><a class="external"
      href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues">CmdStan Issue
      Tracker</a><img
      class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external pdf
      marker"/>
      <span class="note">(on Stan's GitHub)</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that for the time being, CmdStan's issue tracker is the same
    as Stan's.</p>
